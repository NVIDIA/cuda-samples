## Release Notes

This section describes the release notes for the CUDA Samples on GitHub only.

### CUDA 11.6
* Added new folder structure for samples
* Added support of Visual Studio 2022 to all samples supported on [Windows](#windows-1).
* All CUDA samples are now only available on [GitHub](https://github.com/nvidia/cuda-samples). They are no longer available via CUDA toolkit.

### [older versions...](./CHANGELOG.md)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Download and install the [CUDA Toolkit 11.6](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads) for your corresponding platform.
For system requirements and installation instructions of cuda toolkit, please refer to the [Linux Installation Guide](http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/), and the [Windows Installation Guide](http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-microsoft-windows/index.html).

### Getting the CUDA Samples

Using git clone the repository of CUDA Samples using the command below.
```
git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-samples.git
```

Without using git the easiest way to use these samples is to download the zip file containing the current version by clicking the "Download ZIP" button on the repo page. You can then unzip the entire archive and use the samples.

## Building CUDA Samples

### Windows

The Windows samples are built using the Visual Studio IDE. Solution files (.sln) are provided for each supported version of Visual Studio, using the format:
```
*_vs<version>.sln - for Visual Studio <version>
```
Complete samples solution files exist at parent directory of the repo:

Each individual sample has its own set of solution files at:
`<CUDA_SAMPLES_REPO>\Samples\<sample_dir>\`

To build/examine all the samples at once, the complete solution files should be used. To build/examine a single sample, the individual sample solution files should be used.

### Linux
The Linux samples are built using makefiles. To use the makefiles, change the current directory to the sample directory you wish to build, and run make:
```
$ cd <sample_dir>
$ make
```
The samples makefiles can take advantage of certain options:
*  **TARGET_ARCH=<arch>** - cross-compile targeting a specific architecture. Allowed architectures are x86_64, ppc64le, armv7l, aarch64.
    By default, TARGET_ARCH is set to HOST_ARCH. On a x86_64 machine, not setting TARGET_ARCH is the equivalent of setting TARGET_ARCH=x86_64.<br/>
`$ make TARGET_ARCH=x86_64` <br/> `$ make TARGET_ARCH=ppc64le` <br/> `$ make TARGET_ARCH=armv7l` <br/> `$ make TARGET_ARCH=aarch64` <br/>
    See [here](http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-samples/index.html#cross-samples) for more details on cross platform compilation of cuda samples.
*   **dbg=1** - build with debug symbols
    ```
    $ make dbg=1
    ```
*   **SMS="A B ..."** - override the SM architectures for which the sample will be built, where `"A B ..."` is a space-delimited list of SM architectures. For example, to generate SASS for SM 50 and SM 60, use `SMS="50 60"`.
    ```
    $ make SMS="50 60"
    ```

*  **HOST_COMPILER=<host_compiler>** - override the default g++ host compiler. See the [Linux Installation Guide](http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/index.html#system-requirements) for a list of supported host compilers.
    ```
    $ make HOST_COMPILER=g++
    ```

## Dependencies

Some CUDA Samples rely on third-party applications and/or libraries, or features provided by the CUDA Toolkit and Driver, to either build or execute. These dependencies are listed below.

If a sample has a third-party dependency that is available on the system, but is not installed, the sample will waive itself at build time.

Each sample's dependencies are listed in its README's Dependencies section.

### Third-Party Dependencies

These third-party dependencies are required by some CUDA samples. If available, these dependencies are either installed on your system automatically, or are installable via your system's package manager (Linux) or a third-party website.

#### FreeImage

FreeImage is an open source imaging library. FreeImage can usually be installed on Linux using your distribution's package manager system. FreeImage can also be downloaded from the FreeImage website.

To set up FreeImage on a Windows system, extract the FreeImage DLL distribution into the folder `../../../Common/FreeImage/Dist/x64` such that it contains the .h and .lib files. Copy the .dll file to root level `bin/win64/Debug` and `bin/win64/Release` folder.

#### Message Passing Interface

MPI (Message Passing Interface) is an API for communicating data between distributed processes. A MPI compiler can be installed using your Linux distribution's package manager system. It is also available on some online resources, such as [Open MPI](http://www.open-mpi.org/).
