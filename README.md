### Change Log

### [Revision History](./CHANGELOG.md)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Download and install the [CUDA Toolkit 12.8](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads) for your corresponding platform.
For system requirements and installation instructions of cuda toolkit, please refer to the [Linux Installation Guide](http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/), and the [Windows Installation Guide](http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-microsoft-windows/index.html).

### Getting the CUDA Samples

Using git clone the repository of CUDA Samples using the command below.
```
git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-samples.git
```

Without using git the easiest way to use these samples is to download the zip file containing the current version by clicking the "Download ZIP" button on the repo page. You can then unzip the entire archive and use the samples.

## Building CUDA Samples

### Building CUDA Samples

The CUDA Samples are built using CMake. Follow the instructions below for building on Linux, Windows, and for cross-compilation to Tegra devices.

### Linux

Ensure that CMake (version 3.20 or later) is installed. Install it using your package manager if necessary:

e.g.
```sudo apt install cmake```

Navigate to the root of the cloned repository and create a build directory:
```
mkdir build && cd build
```
Configure the project with CMake:
```
cmake ..
```
Build the samples:
```
make -j$(nproc)
```
Run the samples from their respective directories in the build folder. You can also follow this process from and subdirectory of the samples repo, or from within any individual sample.

### Windows

Language services for CMake are available in Visual Studio 2019 version 16.5 or later, and you can directly import the CUDA samples repository from either the root level or from any
subdirectory or individual sample.

To build from the command line, open the `x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS` provided with your Visual Studio installation.

Navigate to the root of the cloned repository and create a build directory:
```
mkdir build && cd build
```
Configure the project with CMake - for example:
```
cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 16 2019" -A x64
```
Open the generated solution file CUDA_Samples.sln in Visual Studio. Build the samples by selecting the desired configuration (e.g., Debug or Release) and pressing F7 (Build Solution).

Run the samples from the output directories specified in Visual Studio.

### Platform-Specific Samples

Some CUDA samples are specific to certain platforms, and require passing flags into CMake to enable. In particular, we define the following platform-specific flags:

* `BUILD_TEGRA` - for Tegra-specific samples

To build these samples, set the variables either on the command line or through your CMake GUI. For example:

```
cmake -DBUILD_TEGRA=True ..
```

### Cross-Compilation for Tegra Platforms

Install the NVIDIA toolchain and cross-compilation environment for Tegra devices as described in the Tegra Development Guide.

Ensure that CMake (version 3.20 or later) is installed.

Navigate to the root of the cloned repository and create a build directory:
```
mkdir build && cd build
```
Configure the project with CMake, specifying the Tegra toolchain file:
```
cmake .. -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=/path/to/tegra/toolchain.cmake
```
Build the samples:
```
make -j$(nproc)
```
Transfer the built binaries to the Tegra device and execute them there.

### Building for Automotive Linux Platforms

These platforms require additional information to be passed to CMake on the command line to ensure proper resolution of all necessary include and library files.
Instead of being in the default location, `/usr/local/cuda/include` or `/usr/local/cuda/lib64`, you must point to architecture-specific paths:

`/usr/local/cuda/<ARCH>/targets/aarch64-linux/lib`
and
`/usr/local/cuda-12.8/<ARCH>/include`

An example build might look like this:

```
$ mkdir build
$ cd build

$ cmake -DCMAKE_CUDA_COMPILER=/usr/local/cuda/bin/nvcc -DCMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda/orin/lib64/ -DCMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH=/usr/local/cuda/orin/include -DBUILD_TEGRA=True ..
```

### QNX

Note that in the current branch sample cross-compilation for QNX is not fully validated. This placeholder will be updated in the
near future with QNX cross-compilation instructions. In the meantime, if you want to cross-compile for QNX please check out one
of the previous tags prior to the CMake build system transition in 12.8.

## Dependencies

Some CUDA Samples rely on third-party applications and/or libraries, or features provided by the CUDA Toolkit and Driver, to either build or execute. These dependencies are listed below.

If a sample has a third-party dependency that is available on the system, but is not installed, the sample will waive itself at build time.

Each sample's dependencies are listed in its README's Dependencies section.

### Third-Party Dependencies

These third-party dependencies are required by some CUDA samples. If available, these dependencies are either installed on your system automatically, or are installable via your system's package manager (Linux) or a third-party website.

#### FreeImage

FreeImage is an open source imaging library. FreeImage can usually be installed on Linux using your distribution's package manager system. FreeImage can also be downloaded from the FreeImage website.

To set up FreeImage on a Windows system, extract the FreeImage DLL distribution into the folder `../../../Common/FreeImage/Dist/x64` such that it contains the .h and .lib files. Copy the .dll file to the Release/ Debug/ execution folder or pass the FreeImage folder when cmake configuring with the `-DFREEIMAGE_INCLUDE_DIR` and `-DFREEIMAGE_LIBRARY` options.

#### Message Passing Interface

MPI (Message Passing Interface) is an API for communicating data between distributed processes. A MPI compiler can be installed using your Linux distribution's package manager system. It is also available on some online resources, such as [Open MPI](http://www.open-mpi.org/). On Windows, to build and run MPI-CUDA applications one can install [MS-MPI SDK](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb524831(v=vs.85).aspx).
