### [bandwidthTest](./bandwidthTest)
This is a simple test program to measure the memcopy bandwidth of the GPU and memcpy bandwidth across PCI-e. This test application is capable of measuring device to device copy bandwidth, host to device copy bandwidth for pageable and page-locked memory, and device to host copy bandwidth for pageable and page-locked memory.

### [deviceQuery](./deviceQuery)
This sample enumerates the properties of the CUDA devices present in the system.

### [deviceQueryDrv](./deviceQueryDrv)
This sample enumerates the properties of the CUDA devices present using CUDA Driver API calls

### [topologyQuery](./topologyQuery)
A simple exemple on how to query the topology of a system with multiple GPU
