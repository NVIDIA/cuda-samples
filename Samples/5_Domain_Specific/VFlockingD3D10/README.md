# VFlockingD3D10 - VFlockingD3D10

## Description

The sample models formation of V-shaped flocks by big birds, such as geese and cranes. The algorithms of such flocking are borrowed from the paper "V-like formations in flocks of artificial birds" from Artificial Life, Vol. 14, No. 2, 2008. The sample has CPU- and GPU-based implementations. Press 'g' to toggle between them. The GPU-based simulation works many times faster than the CPU-based one. The printout in the console window reports the simulation time per step. Press 'r' to reset the initial distribution of birds.

## Dependencies needed to build/run
[DirectX](../../../README.md#directx)

## Prerequisites

Download and install the [CUDA Toolkit 11.6](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads) for your corresponding platform.
Make sure the dependencies mentioned in [Dependencies]() section above are installed.

## Build and Run

### Windows
The Windows samples are built using the Visual Studio IDE. Solution files (.sln) are provided for each supported version of Visual Studio, using the format:
```
*_vs<version>.sln - for Visual Studio <version>
```
Each individual sample has its own set of solution files in its directory:

To build/examine all the samples at once, the complete solution files should be used. To build/examine a single sample, the individual sample solution files should be used.
> **Note:** Some samples require that the Microsoft DirectX SDK (June 2010 or newer) be installed and that the VC++ directory paths are properly set up (**Tools > Options...**). Check DirectX Dependencies section for details."
