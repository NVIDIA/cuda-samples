  Recursive Gaussian filter
  sgreen 8/1/08

  This code sample implements a Gaussian blur using Deriche's recursive method:
  http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/deriche93recursively.html

  This is similar to the box filter sample in the SDK, but it uses the previous
  outputs of the filter as well as the previous inputs. This is also known as an
  IIR (infinite impulse response) filter, since its response to an input impulse
  can last forever.

  The main advantage of this method is that the execution time is independent of
  the filter width.

  The GPU processes columns of the image in parallel. To avoid uncoalesced reads
  for the row pass we transpose the image and then transpose it back again
  afterwards.

  The implementation is based on code from the CImg library:
  http://cimg.sourceforge.net/
  Thanks to David Tschumperlï¿½ and all the CImg contributors!
