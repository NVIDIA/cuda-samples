# 6. Performance


### [alignedTypes](./alignedTypes)
A simple test, showing huge access speed gap between aligned and misaligned structures. It measures per-element copy throughput for aligned and misaligned structures on big chunks of data.

### [transpose](./transpose)
This sample demonstrates Matrix Transpose.  Different performance are shown to achieve high performance.

### [UnifiedMemoryPerf](./UnifiedMemoryPerf)
This sample demonstrates the performance comparision using matrix multiplication kernel of Unified Memory with/without hints and other types of memory like zero copy buffers, pageable, pagelocked memory performing synchronous and Asynchronous transfers on a single GPU.
