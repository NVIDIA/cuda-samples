# warpAggregatedAtomicsCG - Warp Aggregated Atomics using Cooperative Groups

## Description

This sample demonstrates how using Cooperative Groups (CG) to perform warp aggregated atomics to single and multiple counters, a useful technique to improve performance when many threads atomically add to a single or multiple counters.

## Key Concepts

Cooperative Groups, Atomic Intrinsics

## Supported SM Architectures

## Supported OSes

Linux, Windows

## Supported CPU Architecture

x86_64, armv7l, aarch64

## CUDA APIs involved

### [CUDA Runtime API](http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-runtime-api/index.html)
cudaMemcpy, cudaFree, cudaDeviceGetAttribute, cudaMemset, cudaMalloc

## Prerequisites

Download and install the [CUDA Toolkit 12.5](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads) for your corresponding platform.
